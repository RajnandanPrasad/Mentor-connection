# Notification Sounds for the Mentorship Application

This directory contains notification sounds for the mentorship application.

## Getting a Notification Sound

There are three ways to add notification sounds to your application:

1. **Use the built-in Sound Generator:** 
   - Open `/sounds/get-notification-sound.html` in your browser
   - Choose or customize a notification sound
   - Download it as `notification.mp3` and save it in this directory

2. **Download a notification sound from the web:**
   - Find a royalty-free notification sound from one of these sources:
     - https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/notification/
     - https://notificationsounds.com/notification-sounds
     - https://www.zapsplat.com/sound-effect-category/notifications-and-prompts/
   - Download and rename it to `notification.mp3` in this directory

3. **Use the fallback sound:**
   - The application will automatically generate a fallback sound if `notification.mp3` is missing
   - This ensures notifications will always have a sound, even without an audio file

## Sound File Requirements

- The sound file should be short (less than 3 seconds)
- It should be saved as an MP3 file
- It should be named `notification.mp3` exactly
- It should be placed in the `frontend/public/sounds` directory

## Testing Sounds

You can test if your notification sounds are working by:
1. Using the "Test Accept" or "Test Reject" buttons on the mentee dashboard
2. Using the "Test Notification" button in the Chat Debugger
3. Triggering a real notification by having a mentor accept/reject your request

If you don't hear any sound, check the browser console for error messages.
