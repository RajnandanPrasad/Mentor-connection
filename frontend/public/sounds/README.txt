# Ringtone for Video Calls

To complete the video call functionality, you need to download a royalty-free ringtone and save it as `ringtone.mp3` in this directory.

You can find suitable royalty-free ringtones at:
1. https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/ringtone/
2. https://www.zedge.net/ringtones/free
3. https://www.soundsnap.com/tags/ringtone

Download your preferred ringtone and rename it to `ringtone.mp3`, then place it in this directory.

The ringtone will play when you receive an incoming video call in the application.
